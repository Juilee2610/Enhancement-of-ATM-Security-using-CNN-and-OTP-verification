# Enhancement-of-ATM-Security-using-CNN-and-OTP-verification

The surveillance systems have been widely used in automatic teller machines (ATMs), banks, convenient stores, etc. For example, when a customer uses the ATM, the surveillance systems will record his/her face information. The information will help us understand and trace who withdrew money. However, when criminals use the ATM to withdraw illegal money, they usually block their faces with something (now-a-days, criminals usually use safety helmets or masks to block their faces). That will degrade the purpose of the surveillance system. In this proposed system the user is asked to enter his/her credentials, after which an OTP is send to authorized userâ€™s email id, if the user enters an invalid OTP the user is asked to re-enter credentials, if valid OTP is entered further the face of the withdrawer is detected and if the withdrawers face is covered, the user is been alerted to uncover his face. The system will help in reducing thefts and thereby assisting to find the culprit through CCTV footage.
